# BTECH_EVALUATION_TASK
## Raster Tile Mosaicing

A raster mosaicing task focused on generating a cloudless mosaic image by seamlessly merging multiple georeferenced satellite raster tiles (GeoTIFFs). The code should efficiently combine overlapping tiles with consistent spatial resolution and coordinate reference systems, ensuring smooth transitions between scenes. The final output must be a clean, cloud-free mosaic, properly georeferenced and visualized using Python-based geospatial libraries. The complete workflow should be demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle/Colab) using the provided sample raster tiles.

## Key Requirements

1. Design a Python-based workflow to merge multiple adjacent GeoTIFF raster tiles into a single cloudless mosaic.
2. Ensure proper handling of spatial reference, alignment, and NoData values.
3. Produce a seamless, georeferenced raster output suitable for visualization and analysis.
4. Demonstrate the complete process in a Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle/Colab) using sample data.

## Exoected Output

The final deliverables should include:
1. Output Raster File – cloudless_mosaic.tif
  i. Single, georeferenced GeoTIFF mosaic of the input tiles
  ii. Consistent spatial resolution and CRS
2. Code Notebook / Script (.ipynb/.py) – Contains your implementation and workflow
3. README File – Briefly explains:
  i. Libraries used
  ii. Steps to run the code
  iii. Summary of results
